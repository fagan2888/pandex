### pandex
========
_A graphical data exploration tool based on pandas_

The *pandex* package is intended to make exploratory data analysis (EDA) a little easier for everybody, with 
specific focus on those newer to the Python language. Development of this package is inspired by SAS JMP, 
a great GUI-driven program with a terrible scripting language and an even worse debugger. Pandex is not
intended to make the most beautiful graphs in the world, but it should help with quickly visualizing, 
segmenting, and mining the data.
